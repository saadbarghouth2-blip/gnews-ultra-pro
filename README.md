GNews - Ultra Professional (Frontend-only for GitHub Pages)

Instructions:
1. Open the project folder.
2. Edit src/api.js and replace PUT_YOUR_GNEWS_API_KEY_HERE with your GNews API key.
   Note: This will expose the key in client requests.
3. Run: npm install
4. Dev: npm run dev
5. Build: npm run build
6. Deploy dist/ to GitHub Pages (or any static host).

If you want a server-proxy to hide the API key, ask me and I'll provide the server version.
